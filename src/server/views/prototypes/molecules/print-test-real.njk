                                <p class="serif govuk-body">PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGE: Chronic (persistent) breathlessness despite treatment of causal disease(s)[1] is associated with
                                    disability and a vicious cycle of avoiding physical activity-related breathlessness,[2] deconditioning and increasing breathlessness.Those affected
                                    participate less in the workforce,[3] risking curtailing of children’s education to increase income,[4] and need more healthcare.[5] Diseases causing
                                    persistent breathlessness (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),[6]coronary heart disease,[7]lung cancer[8]) are common in India,
                                    mirroring smoking rates, air pollution[9] and poverty.[10] Low-resource countries have a disproportionate burden, accounting for 80% of global
                                    COPD/asthma mortality.[11]</p>
                                <p class="serif govuk-body">Low-cost self-management breathlessness-targeted interventions are effective and deliverable in community-settings (e.g.,
                                    breathing techniques, fans, lifestyle approaches, paced physical activity). These promote well-being, need little medical knowledge[12]; are teachable
                                    to lay workers, relatives or clinical support staff. Such approaches could be scaled up <em>via</em> population awareness, increasing human and social
                                    capital, and decreasing healthcare reliance.[13] However, few are developed or tested for acceptability or effectiveness in India or other low-resource
                                    countries. Despite strong community networks, emerging data suggest that health beliefs may reduce intervention acceptability and need to be addressed
                                    during implementation.[13]</p>
                                <p class="serif govuk-body">PROPOSED INTERVENTION: Our intervention will focus on community worker education. Given the “invisibility” of persistent
                                    breathlessness even in high-income countries, this will incorporate health promotion, raising awareness of breathlessness as a therapeutic target, and
                                    self-management techniques.</p>

                                <p class="serif govuk-body">Chronic (persistent) breathlessness despite treatment of causal disease(s)[1] is associated with disability and a vicious
                                    cycle of avoidance of physical activity (exertion-related breathlessness), deconditioning, worse function and increasing breathlessness. People with
                                    chronic breathlessness reduce or cease activities important for individual and societal wellbeing[2] and, in high-resource countries, are more likely
                                    to use healthcare services.[5] The non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),[6] coronary heart disease,[7]
                                    lung cancer[8]) causing chronic breathlessness are common in India, and increasing, mirroring high rates of tobacco smoking, air pollution[9] and
                                    poverty.[10] Adverse impact has increased since the COVID-19 pandemic.[14]</p>
                                <p class="serif govuk-body">The burden of NCDs falls disproportionately on people in low-resource settings, e.g, India, accounting for 80% of global
                                    COPD and asthma mortality,[10] with high levels of disability due to poor prevention, poor healthcare access, late presentation and younger
                                    onset.[15]&nbsp; In high-resource settings those affected participate less in the workforce,[3] but the younger age-profile in low-resource settings
                                    leads to profound effects on absenteeism <u>and</u> presenteeism, risking children’s education to redress income reduction, and poverty. Breathlessness
                                    strongly predicts COPD impairment in low-resource countries and is identified as a therapeutic target.[13]</p>
                                <p class="serif govuk-body">Most NCDs are incurable; the main therapeutic goal is palliation. A 2002-2003 WHO survey found 7.7% of women and 6.1% of
                                    men in India reported daily breathlessness unrelated to physical activity,[16] indicating severe symptoms.</p>

                                    widespread and serious nature of the chronic breathlessness (see above) and because wellbeing and lifestyle approaches have the greatest potential to
                                    address common misconceptions. Many people, for example, fear that activity is harmful; however it can reduce breathlessness by increasing fitness.</p>
                                <p class="serif govuk-body">Evidence-based,[21] low-cost self-management breathlessness-targeted interventions are effective and cost-effective[22,23]
                                    and deliverable in community-settings (e.g., breathing techniques, hand-held fans, lifestyle approaches such as paced physical activity), reducing
                                    breathlessness severity,[24] breathlessness-related distress,[22,23] and increased breathlessness mastery.[25] With some components, e.g., fans,
                                    emerging evidence shows faster recovery time from exertion-induced breathlessness,[26,27] increased physical activity[28] and reduced
                                    medication.[26]These techniques require little medical knowledge; are teachable to lay workers, family carers,[25,29] and clinical support staff.</p>
                                <p class="serif govuk-body">Clinical practice frameworks, such as the Breathing, Thinking, Functioning model,[30] are increasingly recognised in
                                    high-income countries.&nbsp; Conceptual frameworks such as “Breathing Space”[31] highlight how engaged coping and appropriate help-seeking and health
                                    beliefs (patient) and attention to symptom (clinician) helps maximise the patient's wellbeing, but are developed from literature from which
                                    low-resource setting data is largely absent. However, such a low-cost, community-based approach could be readily adapted to low-resource countries such
                                    as India within a population health intervention. By empowering people to make simple lifestyle changes that improve individual symptom control and
                                    function, human and social capital can be developed and healthcare needs reduced. Many components of breathlessness self-management have not been
                                    developed, or tested for utility, applicability, or feasibility in low-resource countries. Our proposed study recognises the potential relevance of
                                    interventions and clinical tools internationally to the Indian context, along with the need for contextual evaluation and modification.</p>
                                <p class="serif govuk-body">From other health interventions, we know that implementation fails unless the local context and health beliefs are
                                    understood and interventions are adapted.[32] Regarding breathlessness self-management, emerging data suggest that patients’ and clinicians’ health
                                    beliefs about cool airflow, particularly in hotter countries, may make fans less acceptable. Conversely, as shown in a recent realist review of
                                    breathing exercises in people with COPD[33] (in which 58% studies were from Asia, mostly from China), other components such as deep breathing,
                                    meditation and low-level exercise which make the connection between breathing and anxiety may be very acceptable in Asian cultures.&nbsp; However,
                                    clinicians’ management and understanding of e.g., chronic respiratory diseases in low-resource countries suffers from a lack of clinical guidelines and
                                    inclusion in educational curricula, and knowledge of breathlessness interventions may be non-existent. An Indian physician study[34] showed they
                                    recognised chronic breathlessness as a serious problem, but expressed therapeutic nihilism and helplessness to the extent they avoided the subject with
                                    their patients.</p>
                                <p class="serif govuk-body">Whilst availability of pain medications is subject to strict legal and regulatory barriers, no legal barriers exist for
                                    development and roll-out of breathlessness self-management interventions, yet these remain largely un-implemented in low-resource countries.</p>

                                    intervention. Outcomes will have been determined in <u>this</u> proposal (Step 2) and may include ASHA beliefs and behaviours, and patient/client

                                    life) and objective (health service utilisation, physical activity [e.g., step-count], use of breathing techniques). Consistent with a theory-based
                                    research perspective, the emphasis will be on getting a better understanding (empirically) of how the intervention is perceived, understood, used (or

                                    utility. Before/after evaluation of change in beliefs would be conducted. Depending on the study population, this might include measuring

                                <p class="serif govuk-body">As for most people, our work has been disrupted in many ways. Research projects have been delayed, clinical applicants were
                                    taken away from research to undertake clinical work, challenges of data collection with social distancing/working with vulnerable groups and so on.
                                    However, the pandemic has also presented opportunities for our work in terms of: heightened public and professional understanding of breathlessness,
                                    international lesson learning and use of technology to promote collaboration.</p>
                                <p class="serif govuk-body">As a result of COVID-19, there has been a significant discourse on breathlessness as a diagnostic indicator as well as a
                                    symptom to be relieved, with associated public recognition that public health and individual health are entangled. Less positively, the pandemic has
                                    placed huge pressures on primary and community care internationally and increased the need for community-focussed public health interventions such as
                                    that we propose.</p>
                                <p class="serif govuk-body">Many clinicians and people with chronic breathlessness (and disability) have had increased opportunity to access beneficial
                                    educational interventions. Health care practitioners and patients have become accustomed to the use of technology (e.g., audio-visual software) for
                                    educational purposes and for clinical care. For example, members of our team made use of webinars to disseminate training relating to symptom
                                    management to clinicians internationally (Salins, Daniel, Palat) [COVID-19 toolkit]. The International Primary Care Respiratory Group (Williams)
                                    successfully ran a Teach the Teacher training program promoting diagnosis and management of asthma and Clark/Johnson developed an educational program
                                    for online delivery for intervention training of primary care practitioners in use of a palliative care needs assessment tool. COVID-19 has therefore
                                    normalised use of the technologies which we will use to develop our intervention and, dependent upon the outcomes of our realist review, to promote
                                    equitable access and potentially increase the impact of our intervention, whilst also taking into account the populations which may be disadvantaged
                                    with regard to technology (rural, age, socioeconomic deprived [e.g, unable to afford limitless data], less access to technology support).</p>
                                <p class="serif govuk-body">Finally, the pandemic and associated use of technology has facilitated international collaboration without need for
                                    international travel. Johnson, Salins, Clark, Currow, Pearson and Daniel have strengthened methods of collaborative working by conducting a research
                                    project identifying good practice related to opioid availability in India, with Indian data collection conducted from the UK (<em>via</em> Zoom),
                                    regular online project meetings and ongoing analysis and data management using secure encrypted platforms (MS Teams).</p>
                                <p class="serif govuk-body">Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for our proposed project, increased opportunities for accelerating
                                    the impact of community interventions through use of technology and increased our capability as an international team to successfully deliver our
                                    proposal.</p>

                                    approvals from the Hull York Medical School Ethics Board (United Kingdom) and institutional approval from the Karunashraya Hospice in India. As we are
                                    not recruiting research subjects, our Indian colleagues confirm we will not require approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research.</p>

                                <p class="serif govuk-body">We will invite professional and lay people to participate in stakeholder groups. Participation in stakeholder groups will
                                    be voluntary. Stakeholders will be provided with a study information sheet providing details of the project and the nature of their involvement;
                                    attendance will be taken as implicit consent. Lay and professional stakeholders will be given a financial token (£5/hr) of appreciation for their time
                                    in attending meetings/interviews.</p>
                                <p class="serif govuk-body">It is feasible that lay stakeholders with experience of chronic breathlessness may become upset during discussions
                                    regarding the project as it may involve relating their own limitations and impact on life due to breathlessness. We will develop support protocols to
                                    support stakeholders, offering facilities for ‘time out,’ during group meetings as well as support provided by a study team or expert group member and
                                    referral for further support through appropriate channels if required.</p>
                                <p class="serif govuk-body">Medicine is a hierarchical profession in many countries irrespective of resources, but particularly so in India and other
                                    LMICs, and Indian society is patriarchal. We are mindful of the potential power imbalances between the varying stakeholders and so workshops/events
                                    will be conducted separately with stakeholders with discrete roles to ensure a wide range of views are incorporated and all stakeholders are able to
                                    speak freely. Stakeholders may be individually interviewed if they cannot make the meeting, or prefer to do so (e.g., would feel more comfortable to
                                    express views).</p>
                                <p class="serif govuk-body">On all stakeholder groups, we will ensure appropriate gender and seniority issues are managed (e.g., we will take expert
                                    group advice as to whether our community groups should be single gender only), and we note that in India physicians are predominantly men and nurses
                                    are predominantly women.</p>
                                <p class="serif govuk-body"><strong>Other potential consequences of our study</strong></p>
                                <p class="serif govuk-body">Our primary aim is to improve awareness and management of chronic breathlessness. However, people with chronic
                                    breathlessness in India may <u>not</u> <strong></strong>have had their underlying condition diagnosed or optimally managed; our project may encourage
                                    better presentation and recognition of this neglected symptom. As part of our intervention development, we will work with our Indian clinical
                                    colleagues to develop protocols that dovetail with appropriate Indian approaches for NCD diagnosis and management.</p>
