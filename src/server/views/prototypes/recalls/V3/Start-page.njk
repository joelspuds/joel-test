         <p>Find out if the manufacturer has recalled a vehicle, part or accessory because of a serious safety problem.</p>
         <p>You need to get your car fixed or replaced by the manufacturer if there’s a problem. You will not usually have to pay for any repairs or parts.</p>
         <p>The service you use depends on whether you’re checking a car or another vehicle, a part or accessory.</p>

         <h2 class="heading-medium">Check a car</h2>

         <p>You can <a href="">check if a car has been recalled for a safety reason</a>. You can also see the car’s MOT history. You’ll need the registration number to use this service.</p>
         <p>Cars will not show as having been recalled until the manufacturer has told the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA). This can take several days.</p>
         <p>You’ll be told by the manufacturer if a car has been recalled for any reason other than safety. You can also <a href="type-of-recall">check if the car has a fault</a> that’s been registered with the DVSA.</p>

         <h2 class="heading-medium">Check other types of vehicle, parts or accessories</h2>
