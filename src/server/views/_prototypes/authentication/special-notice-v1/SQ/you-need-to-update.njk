          <p>DVSA has changed the MTS authentication process to improve the security of the MOT testing.</p>
          <p>As a result MTS users are asked to add a third security question to their account. Previously the users have been required to have two security questions.</p>
          <p>To update your security questions now, make sure youâ€™ve signed in to MTS with your security card. You can then review your current questions and answers and add a new one.</p>

            <p>Please note that you will only be able to update your security questions if you have logged into the service using your security card PIN number.</p>
            <p>The security questions must be updated by <strong>22 July 2019</strong></p>

            If you do not update your security questions
          </h3>
          <p>After 22 July 2019 anyone who has not added a third security question will not be able to conduct MOT tests. They have to update their security questions before being able to conduct MOT tests.</p>
